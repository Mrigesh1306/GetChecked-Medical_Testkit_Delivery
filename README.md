# GetChecked-Medical_Testkit_Delivery

o	The application is a single place where one can order any kind of test kit either from online or go look for it in a retail store, and then send it for testing. If a customer does not know which test to take, you can have a quick talk with our doctors and they will guide the customer on which kind of test they should take, or should they get tested at all.
o	This improves people’s lives its cheaper than a hospital visit and also generates income to the hospital as more people get tested every day.

Proposed Solution

o	Rather than going to a hospital for a simple blood test or a covid-19 test, the application allows a customer to purchase the test kit
o	Once you order the test kit, it will be delivered to you quicky by our home delivery service from the distribution unit
o	Processing orders might take time if the product is unavailable as the distribution needs to order this from the manufacturer
o	Customer can go to a retail store next to the house and buy the test kit themselves. They can finish the test and get the sample ready at home
o	Once this is done, all a customer needs to do is to mail this and our administrators at the hospital will take care of the test
o	Results will be shown on the application with the doctor’s comments
